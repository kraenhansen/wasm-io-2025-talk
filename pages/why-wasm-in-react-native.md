# Why WASM in React Native?

<!--
(5 min)
- A future of universal apps and libraries:
  - Having a single target for native modules (across OS, architectures and web) is awesome.
  - Libraries with existing WASM targets.
- A good alternative to TurboModules: (existing library already targeting React Native)
  - Targeting a single architecture.
  - A generic ABI, not specific to the library.
