# Status quo

Extending React Native with native code

<v-clicks depth="2">

- You can extend React Native natively with TurboModules
  - Written in C++ / (Java | Kotlin) / (Objective-C | Swift)
  - Access JavaScript environment through the JSI
- Write API prototype (the spec) in TypeScript
  - C++ / Java / Objective-C bindings are generated
  - Bridging between TypeScript and Native types is generated

</v-clicks>

So let's talk how things are done today.
[click]
You can already extend React Native with native functionalities using what's
called Turbo Modules 
[click]
These are written in either pure C++, or C++ with platform native code, such as Java or ObjC.
This is needed to access native UI components. 
[click]
You can access and extend the JavaScript environment through the JavaScript Interface,
which abstracts away various JS engines (JSC and Hermes).
[click]
Rather than writing it all by hand, we use a tool called codegen.
[click]
This reads the TypeScript (or Flow) spec and generates the bridging boilerplate code,
which is for you to implement.
[click]
Also, complex types are automatically bridged between TypeScript and native types.

# Status quo

An example TurboModule Spec

```typescript
import { type TurboModule, TurboModuleRegistry } from 'react-native';

export interface Spec extends TurboModule {
  setItem(value: string, key: string): void;
  getItem(key: string): string | null;
  removeItem(key: string): void;
  clear(): void;
}

export default TurboModuleRegistry.getEnforcing<Spec>(
  'NativeLocalStorage',
);
```

<!--
This is a simple example of a LocalStorage module spec. This acts as a contract.
-->

# Status quo

Generated code

```cpp
class JSI_EXPORT NativeLocalStorageSpecCxxSpecJSI : public TurboModule {
protected:
  NativeLocalStorageSpecCxxSpecJSI(std::shared_ptr<CallInvoker> jsInvoker);

public:
  virtual void setItem(jsi::Runtime &rt, jsi::String value, jsi::String key) = 0;
  virtual std::optional<jsi::String> getItem(jsi::Runtime &rt, jsi::String key) = 0;
  virtual void removeItem(jsi::Runtime &rt, jsi::String key) = 0;
  virtual void clear(jsi::Runtime &rt) = 0;
};

// ...
// much more core below
// ...
```

<!-- 
The generated code looks more or less like this. 
There is more code which is not really important to us right now.

What we should do next, is to extend this class and implement the methods.

# The shortcomings

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Does not cover the Web
- External libraries' build system needs to be integrated
    - Gradle/CMake for Android
    - Cocoapods for iOS
- Gets complicated quickly when using other languages
- You need to expose JS functions manually (writing the Spec)

</v-clicks>

<!-- 

[click] One of the biggest shortcomings is that this approach does not cover the Web.
[click] When integrating external libraries, you need to integrate their build system.
[click] For android, this is Gradle with CMake, [click] for iOS it's Cocoapods.

[click] This approach is not so straightforward when trying to integrate, say, rust library.

[click] When trying to expose native library to JS, you need to write the spec, expose the library functions
manually. And on top of that, you need to maintain it.

# The solution

<v-click>WebAssembly ðŸ’™</v-click>

<v-clicks depth="2">

- The go-to solution to run native code in the Browser
- Platform and architecture agnostic
  - Build artifacts can be used directly (no need to build from source!)
- Designed for performance and security

</v-clicks>

<!-- 

[click]
[click] Using WebAssembly really bridges all gaps we've just talked about.
[click] Since the modules are sandboxed, there's no need to worry about triplets, platforms and such
[click]There's no issues and headaches with integrating build systems. 
You just consume the prebuilds of other libraries.

[click] The modules are sandboxed, and see only as much as we give them access to.
