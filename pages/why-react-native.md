<!--
(5 min)
- Widely adopted (perhaps highlight Expo numbers?)
  - Using a known and popular stack React + JavaScript
  - Backed by Meta
  - Large ecosystem
    - https://reactnative.directory/
    - Numbers?
- Native first (not a web-view):
  - Exposing native UI components rather than re-inventing them (as opposed to Flutter, Cordova)
  - Limited web-APIs available.
- No JIT to machine-code in iOS apps
- Luxury of ahead-of-time build step (as opposed to the Web)
