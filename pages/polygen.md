<!--
- Wrapping the WebAssembly Binary Toolkit's `wasm2c` (matches the AOT capabilities of React Native)
- Code generation of a JSI bridge to expose imports and exports
- Compatible with the web API
- Near native performance (because it's C)
  - (Benchmark result?)
- Limitations?
  - Threading
- Examples:
  - Crypto
