First, a bit about myself. My name is KrÃ¦n - I'm a senior software engineer at MongoDB.

[click] I help build developer tools at MongoDB, primarily Compass, an Electron based GUI to query and administer a database cluster.
[click] I help maintain the Atlas Device SDK for TypeScript (formerly Realm JS). Lots of TypeScript, a bit of C++, supports multiple runtime environments, operating systems and JavaScript engines.
[click] Outside of work, I'm a proud father of two 6yos and a 2yo toddler - all girls. And I live in Roskilde, just west of Copenhagen in Denmark.
[click] Besides spending time with my family and my work at MongoDB (where I work ~ 30 hours per week), I like to build in the public. For this work, I accept sponsorships on GitHub - by Callstack in particular.
[click] Write to me on Bluesky - any feedback is appreciated.
