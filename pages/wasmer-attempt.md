# My first attempt

Wrapping the Wasmer C-API

<!--
KrÃ¦n for 3 minutes.
I'll now share some experiences from my first attempt or proof-of-concept to bring WebAssembly to React Native.
Wrapping the Wasmer C-API in a React Native Nitro module.

## Wrapping the Wasmer C-API

with a React Native Nitro native module

<v-clicks>

- A TypeScript wrapper calling into a native module
- A native (Nitro) module calling from C++ into the Wasmer C-API (wasm.h)
- A small build CLI wrapping the Cargo CLI and Xcode build tools, to produce an XCFramework.
- ðŸ‘€ Very limited subset of the WebAssembly API surface (for now)
- ðŸ‘€ iOS only (for now)
- ðŸ‘€ I'm not an expert of Wasmer nor Nitro modules

<!--
I built a simple TypeScript wrapper calling into a Nitro module.
[click] the Nitro module, call from C++ into the Wasmer C-API (wasm.h)
[click] a CLI builds Wasmer for iOS into an XCFramework.
[click] Note: Very limited subset of the WebAssembly API surface.
[click] Note: Worked on iOS only.
[click] Note: Don't take the benchmark results too literally - I didn't spent weeks optimizing it and I don't claim to be an export on neither Wasmer nor Nitro modules.

<BenchmarkResults xMaximum="5" filterSeries="['Wasmer using JSC']" />

<!--
Never the less, these were my initial results:
About 360.000 ops/s computing low fibonacci numbers.
I was pretty happy about that.

<!--
Until I compared to Safari and saw this.
This was where I resurfaced and looked around for alternatives and learned that Callstack was also building something, leveraging AOT compilation.

If I would have spent a bit more time on benchmarks however,
I would have learned that most of my performance issues were from the code calling into Wasmer.

# Takeaways

<v-clicks>

- Wasmer is fast
- JIT can be avoided, using Wasmer's JavaScriptCore feature
- Not fun to build one side of a C-bridge (as a TypeScript developer)
